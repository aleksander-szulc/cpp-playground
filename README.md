# cpp-playground

This is a nice place to test stuff and learn! We want to learn. Learning is good. Goooood.

## Why?

I used to test everything in a `/tmp` :facepalm: so it's all lost after every reboot :boom:
This way I can keep this stuff and hopefully get back to them in the future :crossed_fingers:
